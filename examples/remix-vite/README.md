# remix-vite

This example leverages Remix's new Vite plugin.

Makes it simple to use `@tanstack/query` + `trpc` in an isomorphic way, alongside all of the great functionality Remix
already offers.

**Usage**

All of these commands are expecting you to be in the root of this repo:

- dev: `yarn nx run remix-vite:dev`
- build: `yarn nx run remix-vite:build`
- start: `yarn nx run remix-vite:start`
